Well hello again - finally!

Yes, it has been a while since I have updated this blog. I won't go into the long explination as to why. But a lot of projects I've been working on recently have me now back, and about to use Github a lot more I feel. 

However, the blog here on Github will not be my **main** blog. The blog here on Github will mainly be for announcing scripts and such that I will be uploading for use. What will the scripts be for? Well, for that you will have to follow me on my main blog, which will now be located [over on Wordpress](http://https://illyionsaga.wordpress.com/).

I have created many CSM websites using Wordpress. However, **this** time I am using the free blog feature of wordpress because I don't have the time to build a site from scratch **and** deal with all that comes with maintaining a site that you are hosting from building yourself. I'm knee deep in other types of design and coding with my new project, *plus* I wish to be able to write and blog reguarly as well as working on this.

So yes, there is little to no time for me to do those things *as well as* build and host the site myself. What I have over here on Github is fine for that.

Again, the blog posts here will be sporatic, mostly having to do with updating on any new sripts I upload into my repository, as well as giving tutorials for how to use the scripts. My main blog is where you should go for more frequent updates.
