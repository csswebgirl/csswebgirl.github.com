Well hello again - finally!

Yes, it has been a while since I have updated this blog. I won't go into the long explanation as to why. But there is a project I've been working on recently, and so I'll be using Github much more continuing forward for it.

So this post is a relaunch of sorts. The blog here on Github will mainly be for announcing scripts and such that I will be uploading for use. What will the scripts be for? Well, they will mostly be for use with the program RPG Maker MV. I will talk more about that RPG Maker project here, as well as any other coding-specific projects I work on in the future.  

The blog posts here will be still be sporadic for now, as I do have to focused mostly on working on and _finishing_ these projects. So the main updates I do make will have to do with updating on any new scripts I upload into my repository, as well as giving tutorials for how to use the scripts.
