This is just a base post test. It will probably be deleted once I figure out how to format and post correctly using this new method.

This is the first time I have ever used Ruby, and the first time I have ever used the terminal shell to install something since college. So far, from what I've seen, the installation has worked.

I attempted to install Jekyll on my computer, but gave that up once I realized I didn't want to mess up the Ruby that is already pre-installed on my computer. I have a iMac running OS 10.9. Ruby is, therefor, already installed, and I had installed Xcode on it a while ago. I installed the command line codes, but then though reading found out that it wasn't a good idea to try and modify my preexisting Ruby installation.

So I went and read up on installing either rbenv or RVM; but, so far, there is no version of RVM for Mac OS 10.9 and there was no way I was going to risk my only one year old iMac by installing the 10.8 version.

As for rbenv, I'm still such a newbie to this stuff that I don't feel comfortable enough to install it just yet.

So basically, I don't have a local version of Jekyll running just yet. However, that's okay, as it still seems I'm able to make make blog posts.

This is also the first time I've ever really used the Markdown program (Mou as it's called on Mac). I still have many of the styling codes left to learn, but I don't think that should take too long. I'm much better at design codes (like HTML, CSS and such) than I am at the moment at things like Ruby and other terminal/shell based commands and coding. Though I _will_ be trying to get better at the latter.
