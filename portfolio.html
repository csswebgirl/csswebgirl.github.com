<strong>Convalescent Aid Society - Website Redesign</strong>

These are three sample pages taken from the full redesign of the website for the Convalescent Aid Society, located 
in Pasadena, CA. The website was given a complete overhaul, and redesigned using WordPress as the CMS. A responsive 
template design was used, and modified with custom PHP, CSS3 and HTML5. Google Analytics was also implemented into the 
site.
